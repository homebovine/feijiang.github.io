Working on the practical challenge of guiding people to learn new beliefs or strategies that result in behavior change can guide the hypotheses tested in basic research by suggesting interesting ideas and questions about how people learn and reason. And there may be a great deal of potential in trying to spell out and test how the vast range of current research in cognitive science on learning and thinking can give novel insight into how to change behavior.<br/><br/>One way my research interest in explanation and learning might be related to behavior change is through improving people's learning of strategies and knowledge (e.g. a CBT framework and set of techniques), and their ability to transfer and apply them to new situations in everyday life. For example, CBT workbooks communicate a lot of knowledge, but vary in how much they prompt participants to explain and make sense of the written text. Research examining the effects of different questions and prompts could lead participants to have a better understanding of why they are using particular strategies and when they will be most effective (rather than memorization or passive learning), increasing their frequency of use in everyday settings. For example, one could combine the effects of trying to apply an ABCDE coping strategy with prompting a participant to explain why and when the strategy will be helpful. The depth and social context of such an explanation could also be enhanced by asking a participant to imagine explaining to another person how and why this strategy could be used to deal with negative situations.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of evidence from education and cognitive psychology (Chi, 1994; Lombrozo, 2006) that explaining written text, specific examples, and problem-solving strategies can have a powerful effect on learning, promoting the transfer and generalization of this knowledge to new situations. But this literature has not made close contact with work on health behavior change.<br/><br/>Another relevant line of research concerns the effects of explanation on the decisions people make (Shafir &amp; Simonson, 1993) and the reasoning they engage in (Koehler, 1991), but again it has not been closely connected with work in clinical psychology or health behavior change. Given explanation's ubiquity, people are prompted to explain or may implicitly do so in many contexts (e.g. CBT, Motivational Interviewing) but connecting this work with the literature in cognitive science may reveal mutual insights into the effects of explanation and how prompts can be used most effectively.Â  <br/></div><div dir='ltr'><br/></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><small>Updated on <abbr class="updated" title="2013-08-03T15:22:56.132Z">Aug 3, 2013</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:homebovine@gmail.com">fei jiang</a></span></span> (<a href="../history.html">Version <span class="sites:revision">1</span></a>)</small><br /></div></div></body></html>
